<1$>That's the wind. 

Use the left and right cursor keys to 
change direction. 

Avoid crashing into walls.<#>

<2$>A door is blocking the exit above.

Make the wind flow into windmills
to open doors.<#>

<3$>Use the up and down keys to change speed.<#>

<4$>Different windmills need to be crossed
at a minimum speed to be activated. 

If there's not enough speed to activate 
a windmill look for another way.<#>

<5$>Make the wind flow into the symbol 
to upgrade maximum speed.<#>

<6$>Make the wind flow into the element to carry it. 

Only one element can be carried at the same time.

Carry all five different elements to the tree 
in order to finish the game.<#>

<7$>Some doors require flowing into more than one 
windmill to open.

Flow into all three windmills before the previous
one stops to open the door.
